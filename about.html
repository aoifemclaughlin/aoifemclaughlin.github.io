         I’m Aoife and I’m a 20 year old designer, currently studying Interaction design in the Belfast School of Art and design.<br /> 
         I am an enthusiastic, hard-working, and sociable individual with experience in multiple creative design projects. I possess an everlasting love for <a class="typo-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/aoife.mclaughlin_/?hl=en"><b>typography</b></a>, Illustration and user interface design. 
          </p>
            <p>
            Eager to learn through doing, I positively contribute to the team effort and innovation in the work place. I would consider myself a people person and greatly enjoy working and interacting with others.
