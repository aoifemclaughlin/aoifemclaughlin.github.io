Design an App based around “travel”. <br /> <br /> 

After some brain storming I came up with a few ideas. <br />
The first idea was a holiday budgeting app. It would show up all the good restaurants at the best price, all the good hotels and the best price, all the pubs, night clubs etc. However, I felt there was a bit too much going on and needed to tone it down a bit. <br /> <br /> 

My other idea was an app for kids. 
They would tell the app where they are visiting. As they are visiting all the major attractions of the country, the app would tell them about the monuments.<br />
I thought this was a much better idea. I could have more fun and creativeity with it, as it is designed for kids.<br /> <br />

I decided to pick a country and cover most topics of population specific to that country. I settled on Japan. I knew I could do some really nice illustrations based on their culture and heritage.  It’s also the 11th most populated country in the world, so I had a lot of data to work with.<br />

       This project was all about illustration so my designs need to be good. I did a few quick sketches to decide which monuments would be best to illustrate. <br /> <br /> 
        I also had more to think about such as layout, buttons, splash screens, etc. I drew out a few different ideas for a splash screen and had a bit of a brain storming session to come up with a name.

        After I had finished all my illustrated monuments, Some of the buildings had very similar colours, so I decided to colour code them so they would be easier to differentiate.<br /> 
        After deciding on a colour scheme, and adding the finishing touches, I placed my artboards in an iphone template.<br /><br />
