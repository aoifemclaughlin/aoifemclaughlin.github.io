        Hilite is a pen used to define any unknown words by a user. <br /> <br />
        By physically highlighting an unknown word in a paragraph of text, HiLite can send the definition to your phone or smart watch. If you come across a word which you cannot even pronounce, HiLite can send the definition to Alexa, who will not only define the word, but also pronounce it for you.

        HiLite is available in a range of different colours and has a matching charger. To charge the pen simply place it in itâ€™s own holder and plug it into a socket. <br /> <br />
        After installing the app on your smart phone, all of your highlighted words are automatically saved into the dictionary section of the app. Here, you can select any word you have highlighted in the past. Once you have selected a word the definition and a list of synonyms appear.

        There are three buttons located on the pen. Two at the top and one at the bottom. The two at the top are used to send to a particular device. For example the top button is used to send information to your phone while the bottom is used to send information to Alexa. <br />
        
        The button at the very bottom of the pen is used when you are highlighting a word. You simply hold down this button while highlighting a word, then press a button sending it to Alexa or your phone.
