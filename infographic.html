<h2>Brief</h2>
<p>
Design an Infographic based on “global population”.
This could be specific to age, gender, country etc. <br /> <br />

I decided to pick a country and cover most topics of population specific to that country. I settled on Japan. I knew I could do some really nice illustrations based on their culture and heritage.  It’s also the 11th most populated country in the world, so I had a lot of data to work with.

        After gathering all the information I needed from different sources, I put together a few sketchs to get a feel for the vibes I wanted.<br /> 
These sketches gave me my colour board and a lot of the main sketches I used in the final outcome.

        I wanted to incorporate the data I had collected into my illustrations. To do this, I had to put a lot more thought into my illustrations. For example, the lanterns below display the population of every major city in Japan, and also show  the relative connection between them.
While I also made the teapot into a pie chart, showing the different age structures.<br /> <br />
